1. Create Github Repo with License & Python gitignore
2. Clone Github Repo
3. Create virtual environment
4. Create setup.py & Requirements.txt file
5. Create "src" folder with __init__.py file inside it
6. Activate virtualenv & pip install -r requirements.txt
7. Create a folder: Components inside src folder & __init__.py file (to create all modules like data_ingestion, data_transformation etc)
8. Create data_ingestion.py, data_transformation.py & model_trainer.py files inside components folder
9. Create another folder inside src folder: pipeline with __init__.py, train_pipeline.py & predict_pipeline.py inside it
10.Create 3 files inside src folder logger.py, exception.py & utils.py
11.Create a folder inside src: notebook & a folder inside notebook : data (to keep data file which we will be working on for model building), Later we can also automate this data scraping & model training on the new data & update the model frequently with new data
12.Create project files inside notebook folder: data assesing, cleaning, eda, model training etc. Now Perform Assesing, Cleaning, Transformation, Engineering, EDA & Model Building, Hyper Parameter Tuning inside all these files & later convert them into modular code which can be automated
